### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to be familiar with adding SVGs to the HTML pages.
This also helped me in thinking about how to align the elements properly.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
    background-image: 
        url('images/bg-pattern-top.svg'),
        url('images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg');
    background-position: top -35rem left -48rem, top 22rem left 8rem;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
